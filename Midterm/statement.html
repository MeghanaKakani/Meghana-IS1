    <h2>Design Statement</h2>

    <p>I chose a clean and vibrant design to reflect the dynamic culture of South Korea. The color palette combines deep blue for reliability and pink-red for energy, inspired by both the modern and traditional aesthetics of the country. The hero images are large and immersive to immediately engage visitors and create a sense of travel excitement.</p>

    <p>The typography was carefully selected: 'Playfair Display' for headings conveys elegance and cultural depth, while 'Roboto' for body text ensures readability across devices. Text placement is centralized on the homepage hero section for a bold first impression and structured in containers on other pages for clarity.</p>

    <p>Buttons are bright and placed below key content to encourage interactions such as contacting us, booking a trip, or requesting more information. Images are styled with rounded corners to feel friendly and approachable, and the navigation menu is consistent across all pages for easy access. Overall, the design aims to create an inviting, user-friendly experience for potential travelers to South Korea.</p>
