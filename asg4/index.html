      <h2>Why I picked Balakrishna as my least favorite</h2>
      <p>
        He is my least favortite is because of his acting as well as his behavior with people. He thinks very highly of himself. When he was young he got alot of fame because of his acting but now that he is 65, we expect him to retair but instead he keeps acting. There is nothing wrong with that but he don't act like a grandfather or a father figure but a main charater figure a hero with womens who are 20 years younger than him..
