	<h1>Assignment 3</h1>
	<h2>Favorite Band, Creative Brief</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><p></p>In one of my club meetings, I believe it was the UX club. We were challenged to look at a school website paper and when I first saw it, I honestly didn’t know what I was looking at. Yale School of Art’s is the perfect example of violation of number 6 (clickable elements are not obvious) because there is way too much happening and nothing is clear which makes users confused and don’t know where to start or what to interact. <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Link Website</a></p></li>
		<li><p></p>After reading the articles, I realized how much help framing a project can help . When framing a project in a story format, it helps refine ideas more clearly and easier to follow and mix mistakes. The framing can be done by breaking it down in narrative structure, roles, motivation, conflicts and resolution. When putting a project into a story structure, you need to identify who the user is, what issue or problems they conflict with, how the design solves that issue or problem and finally what the outcome is. This helps to see what the main parts are, what can be fixed if there are any and make it more refined.</p> </li>
		<li><p></p>The different way to establish typographic hierarchy:</p></li>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Size: larger headlines vs. smaller body text</li>
				<li>Weight: bold or light fonts to signal importance</li>
				<li>Color & Contrast: using color or brightness to draw attention</li>
