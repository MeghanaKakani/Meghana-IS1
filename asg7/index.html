            Hongjoong, the leader of ATEEZ, is known for his creativity, passion, and advocacy for self-expression.

        <h2 id="platform-heading">Top Campaign Platform</h2>
        <p>
          RM’s campaign focuses on three pillars: education, creativity, and unity. His goal is to create a society where art and learning go hand in hand — where education values creativity as much as academics. He aims to promote mental health awareness, sustainability, and cross-cultural collaboration, ensuring that every voice — regardless of age, gender, or background — is heard and valued. RM believes that leadership starts with understanding and that together, we can build a future that balances logic and love.
