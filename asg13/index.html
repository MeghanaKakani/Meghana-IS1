    <h1>My Dream Jobs</h1>
    <p class="summary">
      My ideal job is one where I can combine creativity, design, and technology to build 
      meaningful digital experiences. I enjoy user-centered design, solving problems, and 
      creating visuals that communicate clearly and beautifully. I want a role that challenges 
      me, helps me grow, and lets me use my design and product-thinking skills to make an impact.

    <!-- JOB 1 -->
    <div class="job">
      <img src="images/ahrefs-logo.png" alt="Ahrefs Logo">
      <h2>Product Designer — Ahrefs</h2>
      <a class="job-link" href="https://www.glassdoor.com/job-listing/product-designer-ahrefs" target="_blank">View Listing</a>
      <p>
        This job would be great for me because Ahrefs focuses on creating powerful tools using 
        clean and intuitive design. Their products deal with complex data, which challenges designers 
        to simplify information and improve user experiences. I love problem-solving and building 
        organized interfaces, and this role allows that. Ahrefs also values creativity and independent 
        thinking, which matches the way I like to work.

    <!-- JOB 2 -->
    <div class="job">
      <img src="images/whatnot-logo.png" alt="Whatnot Logo">
      <h2>Product Designer — Whatnot</h2>
      <a class="job-link" href="https://careers.whatnot.com" target="_blank">View Listing</a>
      <p>
        Whatnot is a fast-growing marketplace that focuses on live shopping experiences, which is 
        exciting and very design-driven. I would love this role because it mixes design, branding, 
        and user behavior — three things I care about. The company encourages collaboration and rapid 
        prototyping, which fits my design process. Designing for real-time interactions and community 
        features would help me grow as a versatile product designer.

    <!-- JOB 3 -->
    <div class="job">
      <img src="images/dexian-logo.png" alt="Dexian Logo">
      <h2>Senior Front-End Developer — Dexian</h2>
      <a class="job-link" href="https://www.monster.com" target="_blank">View Listing</a>
      <p>
        This role is a great fit because it brings together design and coding, which I enjoy combining. 
        I like turning designs into real, functional interfaces, and this job focuses on creating clean, 
        efficient, and user-friendly front-end experiences. Dexian works with many different clients, 
        meaning I would learn new skills and work on different types of projects. This position would 
        help me grow technically while still allowing me to be creative.
