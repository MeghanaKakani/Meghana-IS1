	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<p>Future assignment will be listed here.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The early internet was read-only, meaning websites were just static pages with text and links. People weren only view information but couldn't interact.</li>
		<li>As social media platforms grew, the web became more centralized, which ended up starting personal websites.</li>
		<li>The modern stage focuses on AI, and the semantic web, where data is smarter, and more connected giving users more control over their information.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Part 2</h2>
	<p>I am not sure exactly on what I want to do. I havn't decide yet. But I would like to do something with people trying to find their MBTI, or what type of person they are.</p>
