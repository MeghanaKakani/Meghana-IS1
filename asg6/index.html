  <h1>Six Thinking Hats Reflection</h1>

  <h2>White Hat: Focusing on Facts</h2>

  <p>
    When discussing the StarRail website project, we looked at the factual information that needed to be included. 
    My partner and I decided the site should organize information about legendary and epic characters which was also discussed about in class as well, including 
    their abilities, roles, and elemental powers.

  <h2>Red Hat: Feelings and Intuition</h2>

  <p>
    Emotionally, I felt excited about this project because StarRail is a game I enjoy and know well. 
    My partner shared that the idea could really help new players feel more confident and welcomed into the community. 
    We both agreed that the site should have a visually appealing design that reflects the game’s space-fantasy theme, 
    making it feel immersive and fun.
  </p>

  <h2>Black Hat: Judgement and Caution</h2>

  <p>
    During the Black Hat discussion, we talked about possible challenges. One issue might be keeping the data current

    in a way that doesn’t overwhelm visitors. We also discussed copyright—making sure we don’t use official images

    it could stand out as both informative and user-friendly. 
  </p>

  <h2>Green Hat: Creativity and New Ideas</h2>

  <p>
    As the Green Hat thinker, I suggested adding interactive features such as a character filter where users can sort 
    by type, rarity, or element. We also thought of creating short animations or hover effects for each character card 
    to make the site feel more dynamic. This hat encouraged us to take creative risks and make the site not just 
    informative, but also exciting to explore.
  </p>

  <h2>Blue Hat: Organization and Overview</h2>

  <p>
    Finally, with the Blue Hat, we reviewed how all the other ideas fit together. We decided to build the site using 
    organized sections—one for characters, another for gameplay tips, and another for updates. The Blue Hat helped 
    us plan the workflow: research first, design next, and then testing with players for feed
