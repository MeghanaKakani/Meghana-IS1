            <h2>Classmate Discussion Summary</h2>
            <p>
                My classmate and I talked about different ideas for naming our website. We wanted the name to sound inspiring, futuristic, and connected to the word “stellar,” which represents excellence and stars. 
                During our discussion, we came up with the idea of calling our users or players “Stellars,” since it fits the space theme and gives a sense of identity to the people who visit the site. 
                We both liked how this made the project feel more community-based and creative.

            <h2>Chosen Domain Name</h2>
            <p>
                Out of the three options, I like <strong>stellarodyssey.org</strong> the best. It sounds adventurous and fits perfectly with our project’s theme of exploring new ideas and helping others. 
                The word “odyssey” gives it a sense of journey and discovery, which connects well with our audience of Stellars.
