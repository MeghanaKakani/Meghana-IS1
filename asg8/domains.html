      <h2>Classmate Discussion Summary</h2>
      <p>
        My classmate and I discussed possible names for our website. We wanted something inspiring and space-themed, so we focused on the word “stellar.” 
        We came up with the idea of calling our users “Stellars,” since it fits the theme and makes them feel like part of a community. 
        We both liked how this idea made the project sound more creative and inviting.

      <h2>Chosen Domain Name</h2>
      <p>
        Out of the three, I chose <strong>stellarodyssey.org</strong> as my favorite. It sounds adventurous and fits the purpose of our project. 
        The word “odyssey” gives a sense of discovery and progress, which connects perfectly with our audience of Stellars.
