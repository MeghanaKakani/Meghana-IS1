        <h1>Discussion About Website Domain Names</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>My classmate and I reviewed possible domain names for our semester project. We focused on names that are memorable, easy to spell, and clearly describe our website’s content. After sharing our ideas, we each gave feedback and discussed which would best appeal to our audience.</p>

        <p>Out of the three options, the domain name I like best is <strong>StarRailAdventures.com</strong>. It’s descriptive, easy to remember, and reflects the theme of our project perfectly. It also feels professional and engaging, making it a strong choice for our website.</p>
